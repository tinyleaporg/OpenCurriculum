# Tiny Leap's Open Curriculum Initiative

**Open Curriculum** initiative is another step in our journey to make knowledge free, accessible, and beneficial to everyone, regardless of where they come from. We believe that education should be a collective responsibility, and through this project, we aim to develop a curriculum that delivers more value than traditional colleges and universities.

At Tiny Leap, we are committed to creating a fully open curriculum that is industry-relevant, future-proof, and capable of adapting to the rapidly evolving demands of various sectors. Our goal is to focus on the skills and knowledge required for in-demand jobs, ensuring our curriculum stays aligned with what the industry needs. If we identify a career path with diminishing future prospects, we may archive the curriculum for that field. However, all previously developed materials will remain freely accessible.

## Why Are We Doing This?

We believe that society has given us much, and it's our turn to give back. Everyone deserves a quality education, and through the Open Curriculum initiative, we want to make sure that no one is left behind. Knowledge should not be hidden behind paywalls or exclusive institutionsâ€”it should be available to all, and this is our way of contributing to that vision.

## How You Can Help

We are just getting started, and while Tiny Leap will be the sole maintainer of this curriculum, we welcome contributions from experts in different fields. If you're passionate about making education more accessible or have experience in a specific domain, we would love for you to help us shape this curriculum.
